# 🧩 Pac Ludo Fusion

**Pac Ludo Fusion** is a modern AI-enhanced maze game inspired by the classic **Pac-Man**, developed using **Pygame**. Players navigate a **rotating hexagonal maze**, collect pellets, and avoid intelligent AI-controlled ghosts. With each ghost powered by different algorithms—**Minimax**, **A\***, and **Q-learning**—the game blends strategic movement with real-time decision-making, offering a challenging and engaging experience.

## 🎮 Features

* **🔷 Hexagonal Grid Maze**
  A unique hex-tile layout replaces the traditional square maze, creating complex movement paths and a fresh spatial experience.

* **🔁 Dynamic Maze Rotation**
  The entire maze rotates **every 15 seconds**, altering all paths and forcing both the player and AI to re-strategize constantly.

* **🔸 Pellet Collection**
  Collect yellow pellets to score points. Every 50 pellets grants an **extra life**, and some pellets temporarily **freeze ghosts**.

* **🛡️ Player Invincibility**
  On respawn or life loss, players gain a few seconds of invincibility to recover and reposition.

* **👻 Smart AI-Controlled Ghosts**

  * 🔴 **Minimax Ghost**: Uses the Minimax algorithm to predict and intercept your next moves.
  * 🟦 **A\* Ghost**: Efficiently calculates the shortest path using the A\* pathfinding algorithm.
  * 💗 **RL Ghost**: Trained with **Q-learning** and **TensorFlow**, this ghost learns and adapts during gameplay.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

* ✅ Multiplayer support for co-op or versus mode
* ✅ Persistent high score system
* ✅ Advanced animations and sound design
* ✅ Improved Q-learning with saved training sessions
* ✅ Additional power-ups (e.g., speed boost, ghost freeze)
